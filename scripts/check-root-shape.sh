# check-root-shape.sh — enforce the canonical root shape, in BOTH directions,
# against machine-readable/root-allow.txt.
#
#   * an entry at root that is not listed          -> drift (extra)
#   * a listed entry WITHOUT '?' that is missing   -> drift (missing)
#
# The second direction was absent until 2026-08, and its absence is why the
# allowlist rotted: it accumulated 19 permissions for files the April root
# cleanup had already moved into docs/, and nothing could ever notice. A
# one-directional allowlist only ratchets open, so over time it licenses
# exactly the drift it was written to prevent.
#
# '?' marks an entry that is legitimately absent in some conforming repo —
# template-only material removed at mint, or a capability-gated module.
#
# Companion to scripts/validate-template.sh: that script enforces required
# files; this one enforces the shape as a whole.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — root matches allowlist
#   1 — drift (extras at root, or required entries missing)
#   2 — usage / setup error

# directory -- `target/` for Cargo, `node_modules/`, `_build/` for Mix --

# the tempting "fix" was to allowlist an artifact directory that must never be

# Filtering through `git check-ignore` makes the check mean what it says. The
